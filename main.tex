What follows is a test, a demonstration, an exploration and some documentation about how to use this Beamer template/theme.  It is split into separate parts (listed below) and covers why I created this theme,\footnote{In \LaTeX{}'s Beamer document class, a theme is essentially a template.} how to use it, a reproduction of the Scout Branding Centre's Powerpoint slides, some test slides and an example walkthrough from the Beamer documentation.
